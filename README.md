Welcome to my cli project for phase 1 
at Flatiron School.

I  am using the quoteGarden API to get quotes
randomly and also to seach quotes by author 
and genre If one wishes to do.

Everytime an api call is made to retrieve a quote
a new object of the class quote is generated
with its properties such as:
id
quoteText
quoteAuthor
quoteGenre

for example if we choose to get a random quote that a new object 
the same applies if we get quote by author or by genre.

the search quote by author functionality is not perfect so 
might keep working on that in a future version of the app.

to use the app after you clone it to your machine 
first install dependencies by running the following command in terminal
bundle install 
next run the command to run it
bin/run

if you are asked to give permission to the file to run try this in terminal
chmod 755 bin/run

thanks for checking out my app.
